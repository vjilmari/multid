# multid 0.7.0.9000

* Development version
* Add na.rm to qcc bootstrap summary over tau-values

# multid 0.7.0

* Switched from sample to dplyr::sample_n for bootstrap example in the multivariate sex difference vignette
* Minor changes to style and text in the multivariate sex difference vignette
* Additional descriptive statistics to reliability_dms output
* Allow vpc_at for models with no intercept-slope covariation (conditional level-2 variances are same for all requested level-1 values)
* Added function qcc for quantile correlation coefficient
* Updated README

# multid 0.6.0

* Bug fixed in D_regularized_out
* Addend.data argument added to all D_regularized -functions. In _fold -functions, test-partition of the data is appended, else the entire data frame is added.
* Include ICC2 (group-mean reliability) for vpc_at. Enables calculation of sub-group mean-level reliabilities, in case the "at" is a group
* Include reliability_dms that calculates difference score reliability coefficient for data that is difference score between two mean values across some upper-level units (e.g., sex differences across countries)
* Vignette on estimation of multivariate sex differences with multid added

# multid 0.5.0

* Added option to obtain scaled estimates in ml_dadas. Scaling is done for both difference score components and the difference scores, based on random intercept SDs and random slope SD, respectively, in a reduced model without the predictor and the interaction between predictor and moderator
* Added option to test for random effect covariation with likelihood ratio test in ml_dadas from a reduced model without the predictor and the interaction between predictor and moderator
* Added option to include covariates in sem_dadas
* Added variance test with sem in sem_dadas
* Added variance test via parametric bootstrap in ml_dadas
* Added cvv_manual -function for calculation of coefficients of variance variation from manually inputted sample sizes and variances of multiple variables

# multid 0.4.0

* Replaced two-sided tests in sem_dadas for absolute parameters with one-sided tests
* Added three variants of coefficient of variance variation in cvv -function (CVV=coefficient of variance variation, SVH=standardized variance heterogeneity, and VR=variance ration between the largest and the smallest variance)
* Added vpc_at -function for calculation of intercept variances and variance partition coefficients (VPCs) at selected values of level-1 predictors in two-level models

# multid 0.3.0

* Added sem_dadas and ml_dadas functions for predicting algebraic difference scores in structural equation (sem_dadas) and multilevel model (ml_dadas). DADAS acronym follows from the joint hypothesis test of Difference between Absolute Differences and Absolute Sums between (regression coefficients on difference score components).

# multid 0.2.0

* Fixed bug: renaming output in D_regularized_fold functions
* Fixed joining data frames by fold.var in D_regularized_fold functions
* Added statistical inference to d_pooled_sd
* Added probabilities of correct classification option to D_regularized_out and D_regularized_fold_out
* Added area under the receiver operating characteristics to D_regularized_out and D_regularized_fold_out
* Added probability classification tables to D_regularized_out and D_regularized_fold_out
* Added more examples to README file

# multid 0.1.0

* First submission of multid package
