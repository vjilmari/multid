Description: Estimation of multivariate differences between two groups (e.g., multivariate sex differences) with regularized regression methods and predictive approach. See LÃ¶nnqvist & Ilmarinen (2021) <doi:10.1007/s11109-021-09681-2> and Ilmarinen et al. (2022) <doi:10.1177/08902070221088155>.
    Includes tools that help in understanding difference score reliability, predictions of difference score variables, conditional intra-class correlations, and heterogeneity of variance estimates. Package development was supported by the Academy of Finland research grant 338891.
