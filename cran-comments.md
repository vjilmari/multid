* Added three variants of coefficient of variance variation in cvv -function (CVV=coefficient of variance variation, SVH=standardized variance heterogeneity, and VR=variance ration between the largest and the smallest variance)
* Added vpc_at -function for calculation of intercept variances and variance partition coefficients (VPCs) at selected values of level-1 predictors in two-level models

## Test environments
